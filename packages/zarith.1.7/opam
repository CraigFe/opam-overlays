synopsis:
  "Implements arithmetic and logical operations over arbitrary-precision integers"
description: """
The Zarith library implements arithmetic and logical operations over
arbitrary-precision integers. It uses GMP to efficiently implement
arithmetic over big integers. Small integers are represented as Caml
unboxed integers, for speed and space economy."""
